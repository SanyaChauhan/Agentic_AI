# Lab 1: Fine-Tuning in Agentic AI

## Objective
To understand and implement fine-tuning of a language model to improve performance on a specific task.

## Description
This lab focuses on adapting a pre-trained language model using a custom dataset. Fine-tuning helps the model learn task-specific patterns and improves accuracy and relevance of responses in agentic AI systems.

## Contents
- `Lab1_FineTuning.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with implementation and explanation
- `Lab1_FineTuning.pdf` – Experiment documentation in PDF format

## Outcome
A fine-tuned model capable of producing improved task-specific outputs compared to a base model.
